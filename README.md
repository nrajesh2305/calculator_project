# Calculator Project

To use the calculator, simply choose the numbers you want to use, along with an operator in between.
Operations will be executed in the order you put them in!
For example 1 + 1 * 2 would output 4 instead of 3. This is because 1 + 1 is executed first, before multiplying by 2.

Have fun! I will plan on adding more features in the future if possible. :)
